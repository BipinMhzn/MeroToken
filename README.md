# MeroToken
The project Mero Token is enabled in Ethereum platform in order to develop an ERC20
standard token and initiate the initial coin offering in a crowd sale. Its main concern is
to remove the third-party trust issue between the investor and the company and
therefore initiate the crowd fund in easy and fast way. Any tokens developed in
ERC20 standard can be exchanged with each other. “Mero” token costs ether to buy it
which acts as a fund raising for crowd sale. In real world, investors buy into ICOs in
the hope of quick and powerful returns on their investments.

## Objective
● Code own cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain <br />
● Create own ERC20 token and crowd sale with Ethereum smart contracts<br />
● Build an ICO website<br />
